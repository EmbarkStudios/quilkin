## Quilkin Branding Guidelines

The Quilkin logo, mascot, and trademark are made available here with the following
guidelines:

**You may:**
 - use them for non-commercial uses such as t-shirts and stickers
 - use them to link to the project repository 
 - use them in a blog post or news article about Quilkin

**You may not:**
 - Use them in a way that would confuse people about the origin of Quilkin,
   its maintainers or governance structure
 - Use them as your product's logo or trademark
 - Create a modified version of the project logo. The mascot image may be modified as detailed below.
 - Integrate them into your logo
 - Use them in such a manner as to create the impression that your product or
   service has been certified, vetted, or otherwise endorsed by the Quilkin
   project

If the above guidelines do not cover your potential use case, or you're just
not sure; please file an issue for the project maintainers to review.

## Quilly, the project mascot

Quilly is the official mascot of the Quilkin project. They are an adorable hedgehog welcoming all to the project. Quilly is not the project logo; rather they are a fun way to represent the project. You may modify the Quilly image and adapt if for your own use, but do credit back to the Quilkin project. 

Quilly's pronouns are they/them.
