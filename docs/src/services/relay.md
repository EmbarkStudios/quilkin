# Control Plane Relay

| services | ports | Protocol |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| ADS | 7800 | gRPC(IPv4) |
| CPDS | 7900 | gRPC(IPv4) |

For multi-cluster integration, Quilkin provides a `relay` service, that can be
used with a multiple [control plane](./xds.md) services in different clusters to
provide a unified "Aggregated Discovery Service" endpoint for [proxy](./proxy.md)
services.

To connect to a control plane to a relay, add the `--relay` flag to your control
plane with the address of the relay. Then to connect a proxy service to the
relay's ADS endpoint, you use the same `--management-server` argument for
connecting to control planes.

To view all options for the `relay` subcommand, run:

```shell
$ quilkin relay --help
{{#include ../../../target/quilkin.relay.commands}}
```

## Quickstart
To get started with the relay service we need to start the relay service, and
then setup our configuration source. For this we're going to the built-in
relay client in the control plane service to forward information to the relay.
For this demo we'll use the file provider for the control plane, but this
example works with any configuration provider.

```yaml
# quilkin.yaml
version: v1alpha1
clusters:
  default:
    localities:
      - endpoints:
          - address: 127.0.0.1:8888
```

To start the relay, run the `relay` command:

```
quilkin relay 
```

To spawn the control plane and have the control plane send its configuration,
we need to run the `manage` command with the `--relay` flag with the address
of the relay of the relay server we just spawned which is at port `7900` by
default. We're also going to set `--admin-address` and `--port` flags to avoid
port collision with the relay's admin and xds endpoints.

```
quilkin --admin-address http://localhost:8001 \
    manage \
    --port 7801 \
    --relay http://localhost:7900 \
    file quilkin.yaml
```

Now if we run cURL on both the relay and the control plane we should see that
they both contain the same set of endpoints.

```bash
# Check Control Plane
curl localhost:8001/config
# Check Relay
curl localhost:8000/config
```

Since the relay service also exposes a aDS control plane endpoint, that
represents the merged set of all sources, to connect this to the proxy all we
have to do is use the same `--management-server` flag that we use to specify
the location of control planes, then the proxies will be able to pull
configuration from the relay.

```
quilkin --admin-address http://localhost:8002 proxy --management-server http://127.0.0.1:7800
```

We can also additionally add a second control plane source to the relay, which
will be merged with our control plane's configuration to create a singular
set of data that the proxies can query using xDS discovery requests.

```yaml
# quilkin2.yaml
version: v1alpha1
clusters:
  default:
    localities:
      - endpoints:
          - address: 127.0.0.1:9999
```

```
quilkin --admin-address http://localhost:8003 \
    manage \
    --port 7802 \
    --relay http://localhost:7900 \
    file quilkin.yaml
```

And that's it! We've just setup control planes to look for configuration changes
in our system, a relay to merge any changes into a unified dataset, and set up
proxies that make use of that data to decide where and how to send packets.
