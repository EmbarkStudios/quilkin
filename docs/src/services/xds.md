# xDS Control Plane

| services | ports | Protocol |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| xDS | 7800 | gRPC(IPv4) |

For multi-cluster integration, Quilkin provides a `manage` service, that can be
used with a number of configuration discovery providers to provide cluster
configuration multiple [`proxy`s](./proxy.md). With each provider automationing the
complexity of a full xDS management control plane via integrations with popular
projects and common architecture patterns.

To view all the providers and options for the `manage` subcommand, run:

```shell
$ quilkin manage --help
{{#include ../../../target/quilkin.manage.commands}}
```

## Overview

In addition to static configuration provided upon startup, a Quiklin proxy's configuration can also be updated at runtime. The proxy can be configured on startup to talk to a set of management servers which provide it with updates throughout its lifecycle.

Communication between the proxy and management server uses the [xDS gRPC protocol][xDS], similar to an [envoy proxy]. xDS is one of the standard configuration mechanisms for software proxies and as a result, Quilkin can be setup to discover configuration resources from any API compatible server. Also, given that the protocol is [well specified][xDS-protocol], it is similarly straight-forward to implement a custom server to suit any deployment's needs.

As described within the [xDS-api] documentation, the xDS API comprises a set of resource discovery APIs, each serving a specific set of configuration resource types, while the protocol itself comes in several [variants][xds-variants].
Quilkin implements the **Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS)** _State of the World (SotW)_ variant with gRPC.

## Supported APIs

Since the range of resources configurable by the xDS API extends that of Quilkin's domain (i.e being UDP based, Quilkin does not have a need for HTTP/TCP resources), only a subset of the API is supported. The following lists these relevant parts and any limitation to the provided support as a result:

- **Cluster Discovery Service [(CDS)][CDS]**: Provides information about known clusters and their membership information.
  * The proxy uses these resources to discover clusters and their endpoints.
  * While cluster topology information like [locality] can be provided in the configuration, the proxy currently does not use this information (support may be included in the future however).
  * Any [load balancing information][lbpolicy] included in this resource is ignored. For load balancing, use [Quilkin filters][filters-doc] instead.
  * Only [cluster discovery type] `STATIC` and `EDS` is supported. Configuration including other discovery types e.g `LOGICAL_DNS` is rejected.

- **Endpoint Discovery Service [(EDS)][EDS]**: Provides information about endpoints.
  * The proxy uses these resources to discover information about endpoints like their IP addresses.
  * Endpoints may provide [Endpoint Metadata][endpoint-metadata] via the [metadata][xds-endpoint-metadata] field. These metadata will be visible to filters as part of the corresponding endpoints information when processing packets.
  * Only [socket addresses] are supported on an endpoint's address configuration - i.e an IP address and port number combination. Configuration including any other type of addressing e.g named pipes will be rejected.
  * Any [load balancing information][clapolicy] included in this resource is ignored. For load balancing, use [Quilkin filters][filters-doc] instead.

- **Listener Discovery Service [(LDS)][LDS]**: Provides information about [Filters and Filter Chains][filters-doc].
  * Only the `name` and `filter_chains` fields in the [Listener resource][listener-resource] are used by the proxy. The rest are ignored.
  * Since Quilkin only uses one filter chain per proxy, at most one filter chain can be provided in the resource. Otherwise the configuration is rejected.
  * Only the list of [filters][xds-filters] specified in the [filter chain][xds-filter-chain] is used by the proxy - i.e other fields like `filter_chain_match` are ignored. This list also specifies the order that the corresponding filter chain will be constructed.
  * gRPC proto configuration for Quilkin's built-in filters [can be found here][filter-protos]. They are equivalent to the filter's static configuration.

## Connecting to an xDS management server

Connecting a Quilkin proxy to an xDS management server can be implemented via providing one or more URLs to
the `management_servers` [command line](../../api/quilkin/cli/struct.Proxy.html#structfield.management_server) or
[file configuration](../deployment/configuration.md#dynamic-configuration).
