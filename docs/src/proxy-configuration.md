Proxy Configuration

The following is the schema and reference for a Quilkin proxy configuration
file. See the [examples] folder for example configuration files.

By default Quilkin will look for a configuration file named `quilkin.yaml` in
its current running directory first, then if not present, in
`/etc/quilkin/quilkin.yaml` on UNIX systems. This can be overridden with the
`-c/--config` command-line argument, or the `QUILKIN_FILENAME`
environment variable.

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  version:
    type: string
    description: |
      The configuration file version to use.
    enum:
      - v1alpha1
  id:
      type: string
      description: |
          An identifier for the proxy instance.
      default: On linux, the machine hostname is used as default. On all other platforms a UUID is generated for the proxy.
  port:
      type: integer
      description: |
          The listening port. In "proxy" mode, the port for traffic to be sent to. In "manage" mode, the port to connect to the xDS API.
      default: 7000
  admin:
    type: object
    description: |
      Configuration of proxy admin HTTP interface.
    properties:
      address:
        type: string
        description: |
          Socket Address and port to bind the administration interface to.
        default: "[::]:9091"
  filters:
    type: array
    description: |
      A filter chain.
    items:
      '$ref': {} # Refer to the Filter documentation for a filter configuration schema.
  clusters:
    type: object
    description: |
      grouping of clusters, each with a key for a name
    additionalProperties:
      type: object
      description: |
        An individual cluster
      properties:
        localities:          
          type: array
          description: |
            grouping of endpoints, per cluster.
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              endpoints:
                type: array
                description: |
                  A list of upstream endpoints to forward packets to.
                items:
                  type: object
                  description: |
                    An upstream endpoint
                  properties:
                    address:
                      type: string
                      description: |
                        Socket address of the endpoint. This must be of the Â´IP:Port` form e.g `192.168.1.1:7001`
                      metadata:
                        type: object
                        description: |
                          Arbitrary key value pairs that is associated with the endpoint.
                          These are visible to Filters when processing packets and can be used to provide more context about endpoints (e.g whether or not to route a packet to an endpoint).
                          Keys must be of type string otherwise the configuration is rejected.
                  required:
                    - address
  management_servers:
    type: array
    description: |
      A list of XDS management servers to fetch configuration from.
      Multiple servers can be provided for redundancy for the proxy to
      fall back to upon error.
    items:
      type: object
      description: |
        Configuration for a management server.
    properties:
      address:
        type: string
        description: |
          Address of the management server. This must have the `http(s)` scheme prefix.
          Example: `http://example.com`
```
