Proxy Configuration

The following is the schema and reference for a Quilkin proxy configuration file. See the [examples] folder for 
example configuration files.

By default Quilkin will look for a configuration file named `quilkin.yaml` in its current running directory first, 
then if not present, in `/etc/quilkin/quilkin.yaml` on UNIX systems. This can be overridden with the 
`-c/--config` command-line argument, or the `QUILKIN_FILENAME` environment variable.

```yaml

              A set of Standard base64 encoded (with padding) bytes.
              This contains the bytes that will be matched against any capture bytes from packets
              in order to select the corresponding filter chain.
              Note that the values must be unique across all filter chains - i.e there can't be
              ambiguity around what filter chain processes a packet.
            items
              type: string
