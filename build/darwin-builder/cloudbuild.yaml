# Cloud Build script for building and hosting a multi-arch version of
# https://github.com/joseluisq/rust-linux-darwin-builder until there is official support.
#

steps:
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/git
    args:
      - clone
      - https://github.com/joseluisq/rust-linux-darwin-builder.git
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
    id: setup
    entrypoint: bash
    args:
      - "-c"
      - |
        docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install linux/amd64,linux/arm64
        docker buildx create --name darwin-builder --driver docker-container --bootstrap
        docker buildx use darwin-builder
    # We run this twice, because the build takes longer than 1h, the OAuth token expires. So we build once (takes a long time)
    # Then the --push invocation will use the local build cache, so the OAuth token gets refreshed and we can successfully push the multi-platform image.
