- [ ] Create a [Github release](https://github.com/googleforgames/quilkin/releases/new) using the 
  [Github release template](./github-release.md).

    - [ ] Attach all the remaining cloud build artifacts to the release.
- [ ] Submit the release.
- [ ] Run `git remote update && git checkout main && git reset --hard upstream/main` to ensure your code is in line
      with upstream.
- [ ] Run `git checkout -b release-{version} && git push upstream` to create a release branch.
- [ ] Publish to [crates.io/crates/quilkin](https://crates.io/crates/quilkin)
    - [ ] Run `cargo publish --dry-run` to ensure there are no issues.
    - [ ] If there are no issues, run `cargo publish` to publish to crates.io! 
- [ ] Post an announcement to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/quilkin-discuss).
